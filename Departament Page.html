                        <p>AITR has always been at the forefront of adopting new technologies. CSIT department in AITR has three courses those include the emerging areas as recommended by the AICTE committee. As exponential growth in information on various platforms, future engineers must have the expertise in core computer science as well as latest technologies. It requires blending of emerging areas with core subject and therefore AICTE introduced as new branch CSIT.</p>
<p>The courses in CSIT incorporate both theory and practicals/labs in the emerging areas of AI, ML, IoT, Blockchain and Data Sciences as core subjects and Quantum Computing, Virtual Reality and Cyber Security as Professional Electives. The above emerging areas have been identified by the national level committee as part of National Perspective Plan for Engineering Education and accepted by AICTE. AICTE has also prescribed the model curriculum for the above emerging areas.</p>
<p>The course in CSIT is in the AICTE nomenclature and accepted by them as equivalent to CSE and IT. The courses bring the best of both CSE and IT together. The course in CSIT will be accepted as being similar / relevant to CSE and IT and will also be accepted for campus recruitments, not only in private companies but also in government undertakings etc. The graduates of the courses in CSIT will be accepted even for any faculty recruitments for the departments of CSE or IT or CSIT. The graduates will also be eligible for higher education (both in India and abroad).</p>

<p>The graduates of the new course of CSIT will find employment not only in the regular services industry but also in the emerging areas mentioned above; those are specialized in nature and will command much higher salaries. CSIT graduates will therefore have more opportunities than the graduates of CSE and IT courses. Opportunities exist in the area of Design Engineering, Computing/IT Consulting and Solution Developers.</p>
<p>In Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), the student studies designing, implementation, and management of information systems of both software and hardware processes. In Information Technology (IT) the student studies the area which involves installation, development, and implementation of computer systems and applications. Whereas blending of CSIT prepare students for futuristic applications.</p>
<p><strong><b>CSIT Departament in AITR</b></strong></p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science and Information Technology was established in the year 2019. The department endeavors to produce confident professionals to meet the current trends in the emerging world of Information Technology. Currently the Department has more than 300 students’ strength and a team of highly qualified, dedicated and experienced faculty members to mould the students to meet challenges in the field of computer science and Information Technology. The strength of the department lies in the highly motivated students who understand the dynamics of the industry and hone their skills accordingly. The Department is wide to open innovative ideas, to meet tomorrow’s challenges with diverse educational and research opportunities.</p>
<p>Department is having association with <strong><b>Professional Bodies</b></strong> like- CSI, IEEE and ACM.</p>
<p>We have specially designed Labs for Students so that they can learn the latest technologies such as IoT, ALEXA, MACHINE LEARNING, DEEP LEARNING, SALESFORCE, CYBER-SECURITY, ANDROID, and BIG DATA for increasing student understanding of the complexity and ambiguity of empirical work, develop practical skills, increase the understanding of the concepts, cultivate interest in engineering and science learning, improve teamwork abilities and perform Research Activity.</p>
